== About Me
I am currently an junior undergraduate student at the [http://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ce Department of Civil Engineering], [http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/ Tsinghua University]. I also minor in [http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/mathen/ Mathematics].

I have been doing some research under the supervision of [http://www.cre.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/creen/7651/2015/20150921233654322396906/20150921233654322396906_.html Prof. Ruimin Li] since Dec.2017. 
During the summer holiday of 2018, I visited [https://www.purdue.edu/ Purdue University] as a visiting student. During the six weeks I spent at Purdue, I worked on ride-sharing algorithm design and optimization adivised by [http://www.satishukkusuri.com/ Prof. Satish Ukkusuri] and [http://www.satishukkusuri.com/xinwu-qian.html Dr.Xinwu Qian].

I am interested in formulating a research problem in a mathematical way and solve it with rigorous analysis and proof. The goal of my research is to give a theoretical solution of a complex problem, which is more fundamental and can be applied in more cases instead of the specific case we are facing with. My research interests include Intelligent Transportation, Algorithms, Network and Optimization.
